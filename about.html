            <p>
                We are <span class="highlight">Amoriem Labs</span> (or simply, <span class="highlight">Amoriem</span>):
                Yale's first and
                only video game development club! Led entirely by students,
                we unite passionate gamers, programers, artists, musicians,
                storytellers, and designers to bring digital worlds to life.
                Amoriem was founded in 2019 and has been making video games
                ever since. We are the place for your game design ideas
                and visions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We meet <span class="highlight">every week in-person</span> and <span class="highlight">provide
                    food</span> to fuel up
                members for a long and productive game-making session! In
                these meetings, project leaders will go over the previous
                week's accomplishments and work with members to set goals for
                the next week. The expectation is that members will be working
                at the weekly meetings and then throughout the week to
                meet their goals by the next meeting. A typical goal may be "design
                these two character animations by next week".
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">No experience is required!</span> Our current members have experience in
                a wide variety of software (i.e. Unity) and will host robust training
                programs and tutorials so that you can get started quickly. This is
                the perfect chance to <span class="highlight">pick up new skills</span> and put them into practice to
                create real tangible games.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to making games, we also host <span class="highlight">game nights</span> and participate
                in <span class="highlight">game jams</span> throughout the year. If you are interested in any of
                the stuff mentioned so far, please join our <a

        <div class="about-us">
            <p>
                Once upon a time, in an ordinary evening during the winter break of 2019,
                <span class="highlight">Christie Yu</span> ('22) was watching a playthrough
                of Toby Fox's <em>Deltarune</em>, the sequel to his megahit indie game <em>Undertale</em>.
                With just a few collaborators and a lot of hours during his college years, Toby Fox
                created one of the most influential indie games of all time. Christie, inspired by
                the video, sent out an email to the CS majors mailing list in order to scout for interest
                in a video game development club<span>&#8212;</span>the first and only on Yale's campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                After receiving over twenty responses, <span class="highlight">YGames</span> was born.
                The club was informal, but nonetheless met for the first time in the spring of 2019.
                These pioneer members worked on <span class="highlight"><em>Amoriem</em></span> the game,
                a dungeon-based local multiplayer game where two characters worked together to escape a
                complex labyrinth. The goal was to create a demo for <span class="highlight">Bulldog Days</span>
                in April, where Yale's admitted students come to campus and see what the university has to
                offer. With a time crunch of a few months, the initial take-off for <em>Amoriem</em> was challenging.
                However, after much hard work and tireless dedication, the game was successfully exhibited to
                eager pre-frosh and Yalies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Bulldog Days was over, the club got to work on officially becoming a club. The original
                official name was YGames, and then later became Yale Game Devs. Eventually, the name
                <span class="highlight">Amoriem Labs</span> was chosen as a homage to the first game
                it created. The name is an anagram of <em>memoria</em> ("memory" in Latin), and include
                the words <em>amor</em> ("love" in Spanish) and <em>mori</em> ("to die" in Latin). These
                were the three central themes of the club's pilot game. But more importantly, it has a nice ring to it.
                :)
